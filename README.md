# San-Francisco-Crime-Classification
My solution for the San Francisco Crime Classification competition on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/sf-crime). The aim of the competition was to predict the category of crime that occurred in San Francisco by using time and location. I used the xgboost method, and tried to made new features to improve the performance of the xgboost.
